Updated contact info

3.1.0 (7/27/2009)
User can now specify nugget matrix exactly; when replicate runs are available, mlegp can fit a GP to sample means and use a plug-in estimate for the nugget, unless a nugget matrix is specified. 

Because package adapt is archived, all SA functions have been removed. A full version of mlegp, which includes SA functionality, is available from http://users.nsula.edu/dancikg/mlegp.

2.2.6 (2/25/2009)
No changes to mlegp functionality; Changed PKG_LIBS in Makevars.win

Updated contact information

2.2.4 (4/24/2008)
Makevars files use PKG_CPPFLAGS instead of PKGCFLAGS

2.2.1 (2/1/2008)
If var-cov becomes singular in BFGS method, we will use estimates from simplex method
2.2 (12/26/2007)
We should not use absolute tolerance in simplex method; set abs.tol to -DBL_MAX to prevent early exit in nelder_mead.c

2.0 (12/7/2007)
Removed dependence on GSL; uses R BLAS libraries for linear algebra routines

1.1 (10/6/2007)
Windows binary now available. However, user will have to download gsl and gslcblas dlls and put them on the path for mlegp to load
