2.2 (12/26/2007)
We should not use absolute tolerance in simplex method; set abs.tol to -DBL_MAX to prevent early exit in nelder_mead.c; also fixed a bug so that minimum nugget is added correctly in mlegp and createGP

2.0 (12/7/2007)
Removed dependence on GSL; uses R BLAS libraries for linear algebra routines

1.1 (10/6/2007)
Windows binary now available. However, user will have to download gsl and gslcblas dlls and put them on the path for mlegp to load
